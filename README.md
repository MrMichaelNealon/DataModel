# db.php

This is a simple data model I wrote for an app I'm currently working on (Bug tracker - updates to follow in the next few weeks).

I'll be ripping Mana down soon as I've re-written the entire thing for my current project. Mana is ok but thee are parts I'm not proud of or keen on, plus it wasn't properly namespaced - mark II is better quality and I've been testing individual modules with PHPUnit so it's pretty tight!

ButI like this module, I used it to write a command line application but it slots really well into a back-end framework with no problems at all. it's a neat little module so hopefully someone might find use for it, or just learn something from reading over the code.


## Features

It's written for MySQL/MariaDB and features the usual CRUD functionality, it also created tables automatically - all you need to do is create a class that extends the DataModel and you're good to go!

I won't keep you here, the code is pretty well commented so I'd only be re-hasing what I've already written.

Feel free to do as you please with it - throw your flames this-a-way and keep it clean, this is a child-friendly git!
